This repository holds the documentation and code for the assignment in the Course C\+O\+P290 (Design Practices). The aim of this project is to develop a software package for Engineering Drawing.

\section*{Project Specifications\+:-\/}

Design and implementation a software package for Engineering drawing. The package will have the following functionalities\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item We should be able to interactively input or read from a file \+:-\/ i.) an isometric drawing ii.) a 3D object model iii.) projections on to any cross section plane.
\item Given a 3D model description we should be able to generate Orthographic Projections on to any cross section or cutting plane.
\item Given three orthographic projections we should be able to recover the 3D description of the object.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\section*{Directions to Use \+:-\/}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item compile using make command
\item change directory to build by using cd build
\item use ./main to run the executable file
\item write the input file name on command prompt (text file)
\item Enjoy the rotation functionality if using the 2D to 3D.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\section*{Assumptions\+:-\/}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item if the plane of projection is above the origin then its considered to be top view else bottom view.
\item 3D objects are represented as wire-\/frame model.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\section*{Changes after last submission\+:-\/}

Have removed some files like Auxilliary\+Func2\+D.\+h, Auxilliary\+Func3\+D.\+h, Recreate2\+D.\+h, Recreate3\+D.\+h, Reduce2\+D.\+h and Recreate3\+D.\+h due to following reasons
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The input taken is already in a reduced form.
\item Recreate part is incorporated in 3\+Dto2\+D.\+cpp.
\item Auxilliary functions(\+Rotate) is used only in only one case so didn\textquotesingle{}t make much sense to create a seperate file for that.
\item corresponding .cpp files for the .h files are made and the directory is restructure so that it become same as Proff. Su\+Ban directed in the session just after submission of last part. 
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
